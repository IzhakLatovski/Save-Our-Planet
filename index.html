        <h2>Use Reusable Bags</h2>
        <p>
          Plastic grocery-type bags that get thrown out end up in landfills or
          in other parts of the environment. These can suffocate animals who get
          stuck in them or may mistake them for food. Also, it takes a while for
          the bags to decompose. Whether you are shopping for food, clothes or
          books, use a reusable bag. This cuts down on litter and prevents
          animals from getting a hold of them. There are even some stores (such
          as Target) that offer discounts for using reusable bags! These bags
          are useful for things other than shopping as well. I have heard of
          people using reusable bags when they move! If you forget your bags at
          home, buy a new one. Better yet, keep a couple bags in your car so you
          never leave home without them (just make sure you remember you put
          them there)! If you are in a position where you need to use the
          plastic bags, reuse them the next time you go shopping, or use them
          for something else. Just do not be so quick to throw them out! There
          are some states that are outlawing or charging extra for using plastic
          bags. Using reusable bags helps the environment AND your budget!
        </p>

        <h2>Print as Little as Necessary</h2>
        <p>
          We have all had that teacher that wanted us to have a copy of every
          single reading when we come to class, or that professor who wanted a
          hard copy of the ten-page paper that is due next week. These are fine
          but it seems as if they do not understand that using so much paper is
          detrimental to the environment. What can you do? Ask your teacher if
          you can bring a laptop or an e-reader to class so that you can
          download the reading onto that and read it from there. If not, print
          on both sides of the page to reduce the amount of paper used. If you
          need to turn in a long paper, ask the professor if it is okay to print
          on both sides of the page and explain why you’re asking. Most teachers
          care about the environment as well and would be willing to allow you
          to do so.
        </p>

        <h2>Recycle</h2>
        <p>
          Recycling is such a simple thing to do, but so many people don’t do
          it. Many garbage disposal companies offer recycling services, so check
          with the company you use to see if they can help you get started! It
          is as simple as getting a bin and putting it out with your trash cans
          for free! Also, check with your RA to see if recycling options are
          offered in your dorm. Another way to recycle is to look for recycling
          cans near trashcans. Instead of throwing recyclables in the trash with
          your non-recyclables, make a point to take an extra step to locate
          recycling cans around your campus.
        </p>

        <h2>Use a Reusable Beverage Containers</h2>
        <p>
          Instead of buying individually-packaged drinks, consider buying a bulk
          container of the beverage you want and buying a reusable water bottle.
          Not only will this help the environment, but it will also help you
          save money since you are buying a bulk container. Many campuses offer
          water fountains designed for drinking as well as for refilling
          reusable water bottles. Make use of these fountains throughout the day
          when you finish off the initial beverage. Along these lines, many
          restaurants offer reusable containers for drinks. If you go to a
          certain place a lot, consider buying one of these containers to help
          minimize waste. A lot of coffee shops even offer a discount to
          customers who use a reusable container for their drinks. Starbucks, as
          an example, offers a small discount for customers who do this. Saving
          the environment and money? Win-win.
        </p>

        <h2>Don’t Throw Your Notes Away</h2>
        <p>
          At the end of the semester, students are often stuck with notes they
          don’t need anymore, especially from GenEd classes that had little, if
          anything, to do with their major. The good news is that teachers that
          teach GenEd classes have to keep their material consistent with
          guidelines from the college/university. This means that students next
          semester will be learning basically the same material you learned from
          a class. If you took great notes, ask your teacher to connect you with
          students in a future class so that you can give them your notes. These
          notes will help students by being able to read what they are learning
          in the words of another student. It is beneficial to read things that
          are worded differently than what the teacher said. You may need to
          find a student on your own, depending on the teacher’s load for the
          semester. It will feel great to help others taking the same class! You
          can list your notes on online college boards. While some may be
          willing to buy the notes at a price, it will feel just as good giving
          them your notes for free since you are helping them out! Also, other
          student organizations may appreciate notes. At the community college I
          attended, the Veteran’s Club had a separate building for resources.
          They had an area for textbooks used by students, and they could check
          the books out for a semester, and many people would bundle notes in
          with the books. Ask around to see if any organization has something
          like this. If you can’t find anyone to give the notes to, at the very
          least, recycle the paper you used.
        </p>

        <h2>Save Electricity</h2>
        <p>
          Use energy-efficient light bulbs instead of regular bulbs. They last
          longer, which will save you a bit of money (every little bit helps on
          a college budget, right?). Make you turn off lights, the TV, and other
          appliances when you are not using them. Lower your air conditioning or
          heat when it’s not necessary. This is especially true for between
          seasons. Open your windows in the early fall or layering your clothes
          in the early fall.
        </p>

        <h2>Save Water</h2>
        <p>
          Water is wasted more frequently than we can see. Turn off the faucet
          as you are brushing your teeth. Don’t turn your shower on until you’re
          ready to get in and wash your hair. Limit your water usage as you wash
          dishes. Changing old habits will be good for both the environment and
          your wallet!
        </p>

        <h2>Avoid Taking Cars or Carpool When Possible</h2>
        <p>
          Cars are harmful to the environment. Taking public transportation,
          walking, or riding a bike to class are better options that help the
          environment and your budget, as well as getting some exercise in! If
          you do need to use your car, compare schedules and places of residency
          with those in your classes. You can split the cost of gas and have
          alternating schedules for who drives when. This is cheaper than
          everyone driving separately and you’ll be closer with friends!
